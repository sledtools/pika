# What's a Hypernote?

*ALPHA TESTERS WANTED*

What if the web was social and decentralized by default?

Hypernote lets you build rich <text size="2xl" color="blue-500">"hypermedia"</text> pages, just like the old fashioned web, but with the permissionless, social, and decentralized foundation of nostr.

<text align="center" size="2xl" color="pink-500">Let's make personal "webpages" fun again!</text>

To make a Hypernote you need to login with a nostr account. Then open up the editor.

it's this button

If you don't want to start from a blank slate, you can "fork" any hypernote you find

The editor lets you build hypernotes in "MDX" syntax. Basically it's like writing a blog post in markdown, but you can also put in special layout components like `<vstack>` and `<hstack>`.

To add background colors and borders and stuff you can guess at the syntax and write in code, or use the handy properties editor on the sidebar. Just on the text of the component you'd like to edit and you should see the properties show up.

To publish your hypernote, just click the publish button on the top right!

</vstack> 

You can always publish now, make some changes, and publish again... **I recommend publishing early in fact because I don't have a good local save system yet for the editor.**

Your Hypernote will show up on the general feed, and you can also get a direct url to the naddr of your hypernote by clicking "view".

Hypernote is open source, contributions welcome! However, there's still no "standard" for hypernotes, so create them at your own risk: **what you build now might break in the future!** Once we know this is good and useful for people I'll propose a nip for standardizing a "1.0"

Have fun, and please share what you create!

Love,  
Paul
